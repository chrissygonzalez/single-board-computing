# Sunrise

## The Problem

It is _so dark_ in the morning after daylight savings ends.

I used to live in Seattle, where it's dark for a lot of the year, and I had a [Philips Wake Up light](https://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/HF3471_60/wake-up-light) that worked wonders. I liked it a lot, but it was pretty big, and eventually I moved and it broke or I gave it away and that was that. Recently though, I've been trying to get stuff done in the mornings, but I keep sleeping later than I mean to because it's so dark and cozy. I needed another wake-up light, but now I have a cool [internet radio clock](https://gracedigital.com/products/mondo-elite) that takes up my nightstand space. I couldn't find anything that was just a light that would turn on at a specific time without also including clock, a speaker, or an Alexa, so I made this one.
