# Reminder

## The Problem

Pandemic times, 2020. My husband and I were lucky that we could both work from home, but my daughter did all of second grade remotely. She had 6 separate 15- to 30- minute meetings a day, with at least two variations in the schedule during the week. We couldn't always be in the room to tell her a class was starting, and frankly, when we were, she was cranky about it. So we foisted the job onto a Raspberry Pi.

## Hardware Used

- A Raspberry Pi (any will do)
